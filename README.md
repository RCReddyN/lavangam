<h1>This is Lavangam!</h1> 
<ul>
<li><b>Lavangam</b> is a commandline spellchecker written in Python.
<li>Do not judge me for the kind of names I use. It is funny. Atleast, to me.
<li>It uses a Trie internally to store/search for words.
<li>Levenshtein's algorithm for minimum distance is used to suggest words and the distance is set to seven involuntarily. Currently, the algorithm that is used is recursively written, so do not toy around.
</ul>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<ul>
<li>To use the spell-checker, run the script named lavangam.py.
<li>Type in that word you want to type to check if it works as you thought it would.
</ul>
