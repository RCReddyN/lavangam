<h1>This is Lavangam!</h1> 
<ul>
<li><b>Lavangam</b> is a commandline spellchecker written in Python.
<li>Do not judge me for the kind of names I use. It is funny. Atleast, to me.
<li>It uses a Trie internally to store/search for words.
<li>Levenshtein's algorithm for minimum distance is used to suggest words and the distance is set to seven involuntarily.
</ul>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<ul>
<li>To use the spell-checker, run the script named lavangam.py.
<li>Type in that word you want to type to check if it works as you thought it would.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A <b>Trie</b>, pronounced as "try", is a n-ary tree used to store and search for strings efficiently. Read more about tries <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie#Algorithms">here</a>.
<li><b>Levenshtein's distance</b>, simply refered to as edit-distance, is a metric used to measure difference between two strings. It assumes that the minimum distance is the number of single character edits (insertion, deletion and replacement) required to make two strings equal.
