<ul>
<li> Lavangam is a command-line spell checker written in Python.
<li> Please, do not judge me for the kind of names I use. It is funny. Atleast, to me.
<li> Lavangam, internally, uses a Trie internally to store/search for words.
<li> An elephantine collection of words from NLTK corpus, is used to contruct the trie, so expect a second delay.
<li> Levenshtein's algorithm for minimum distance is used to suggest words.
</ul>

## Usage

```sh
./lavangam
```

## Things you might want to know
<ul>
<li>A <b>Trie</b>, pronounced as "try", is a n-ary tree used to store and search for strings efficiently. Read more about tries <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie#Algorithms">here</a>.
<li><b>Levenshtein's distance</b>, simply refered to as edit-distance, is a metric used to measure difference between two strings. It assumes that the minimum distance is the number of single character edits (insertion, deletion and replacement) required to make two strings equal.
</ul>
